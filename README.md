The network traffic graph project involves creating a web-based visualization tool that monitors and displays real-time network traffic data. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive dashboard that helps users track and analyze network activity effectively.

### Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Display real-time network traffic data using JavaScript libraries like Plotly.js or Chart.js.
   - Continuously update the graph to reflect the latest traffic information.

2. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - Use libraries such as D3.js for creating highly customized and interactive network graphs.
   - Enable features like zooming, panning, and tooltips to provide a detailed view of the network traffic.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the dashboard is responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
   - Use CSS to style the dashboard, ensuring it is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Fetch network traffic data from various sources, potentially using APIs or direct data feeds.
   - Process and visualize the data in a meaningful way, highlighting key metrics and trends.

5. **Customization and Automation**:
   - Allow users to customize the display settings, such as selecting specific network nodes or time frames.
   - Implement HTML data attributes
